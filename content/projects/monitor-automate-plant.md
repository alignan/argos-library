# IoT automated plant watering and monitoring system

This project idea came out while thinking about stuff to build before year 2017 ends.  The motivation is simple: avoid plants dying in my watch, likely also saving some lives in my wife's garden as well if everything goes OK.

Whilst installing sensors is easy, I want to experiment with other technologies and paradigms as well, thus this project is a sandbox to learn and test new concepts and applications, having a concrete use case in mind.

The plant is kept in my office desk, and I want to make sure it is well taken care of while I am in a business trip, holidays, or simply to busy in-between meetings.
