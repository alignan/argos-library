# The 2017 challenge

I was a bit bored and feeling depressed by end of September 2017 - living in Berlin eight months away from my family took most of my motivation and sanity, and I was getting my "kicks" only from my job, which is OK, but going also from developer to full manager has its downsides...

At the [Deadline Demo Party](http://deadline.untergrund.net), while coding and watching some Intros, I made up my mind, and decided to challenge myself, and try to do 26 things before 2017 ended.  It was the right atmosphere, and the right time.

This is a Meta project, as it has spawned several ones (including this blog), thus I will not keep track of references here, but likely the related blog posts will include the `Challenge 2017` tag.

And of course, I made a Github repository, in which I'm tracking the progress with issues associated to my milestone completion:

This project will end December 31th, 2017.
