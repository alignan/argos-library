# The 2017 challenge

I was a bit bored and feeling depressed by end of September 2017 - living in Berlin eight months away from my family took most of my motivation and sanity, and I was getting my "kicks" only from my job, which is OK, but going also from developer to full manager has its downsides...

At the [Deadline Demo Party](http://deadline.untergrund.net), while coding and watching some Intros, I made up my mind, and decided to challenge myself, and try to do 26 things before 2017 ended.  It was the right atmosphere, and the right time.

This is a Meta project, as it has spawned several ones (including this blog), thus I will not keep track of references here, but likely the related blog posts will include the `Challenge 2017` tag.

And of course, I made a Github repository, in which ~~I'm tracking~~ I tracked the progress with the issues associated to my milestone completion:

The associated milestone (Github): https://github.com/alignan/things-to-do/milestone/1?closed=1.

This project ~~will end~~ finished on December 31th, 2017 - here is my procrastination chart:

I managed a 42% of goals completion, which is not a bad number considering I was too optimistic (now I know 2 goals per week is close to impossible as family and work obligations are difficult to conciliate), and it put me in the right track to go out of my way and finish pending and new things.

My take out of 2017 is a new mindset to approach challenges and discipline to pursue goals, whilst having fun and learn more about myself in the process.
