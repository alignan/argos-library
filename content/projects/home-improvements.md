# Improve my home with connected devices and fancy gadgets

This is something I was yearning to do for a long time, and as we moved to a new city recently (well, kinda of) finally I had the change to do it right from the beginning.  Home improvements is short for "connecting a lot of things together", including but not limited to light bulbs, ambient sensors, cameras, automated blinds, etc. - anything that would make my wife either crazy or forever thankful.
