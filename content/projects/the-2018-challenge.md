# The 2018 challenge

This is a continuation from the [2017 challenge]({{< relref "projects/the-2017-challenge.md" >}}), a great one I hope to keep up for a very long time (and of course to finish).

This is a Meta project, as it will spawned several ones, thus I will not keep track of references here, but likely the related blog posts will include the `Challenge 2018` tag.

And of course, I made a Github repository, in which I'm tracking the progress with the issues associated to my milestone completion:

[**The 2018 challenge Github repository**](https://github.com/alignan/things-to-do)

The associated milestone (Github): https://github.com/alignan/things-to-do/milestone/2.

This project will end on December 31th, 2018.
