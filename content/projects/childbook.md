# Erin's children's book

This project is quite personal, as it is my first children's story ever to be published solely for my daughter, Erin.  It has a lot of inside jokes and references.

It was meant to be her birthday's gift (last May), however due to work and other demons, it had to be postponed and now it will be her Christmas present - I hope I don't screw up this time.

I had a lot of fun writing this story: [Erin y Poki en el otro lado del Espejo](https://github.com/alignan/cuento-erin-y-poki).

It was as well my first attempt to write something towards continuous automation.  I had the chance to learn more about `Pandoc`, its syntax, and its quirks.  In the past I wrote my IoT book using `Pandoc` as well, but I was using [AsciidocFX](https://github.com/asciidocfx/AsciidocFX) which hid most of the complexity.

I built the sources locally, as I don't feel comfortable uploading family photos to the public - yes, I'm using personal images to illustrate the book, but I'm only planning to print copies for the family.  A `Makefile` was provided to ease building for different formats (PDF, EPUB and HTML5).

The book was sent to [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com) for printing, each copy 16.17â‚¬ (full color hardcover edition 15,24 x 22,86 cm).  I love being a self-published author.
