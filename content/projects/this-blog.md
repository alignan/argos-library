# This blog

Creating an improving this blog is itself a project.  Although I prefer to keep day to day progress in separate blog posts, I thought it would be good to keep track of the projects' evolution in a single placeholder - tags are also helpful and included, but this way I can have a better index for my own later reference.

Some specific about the blog, like minimum improvements like adding tags, categories, or internal links, are not necessarily tracked in a post, as I already made publicly available the blog's sources - peep as you need!
