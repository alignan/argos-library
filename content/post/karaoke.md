# A Karaoke night

This is part of my [Challenge to make 26 things before 2017 ends](https://github.com/alignan/things-to-do/blob/master/README.md).

Me, my wife and close friends went to the [Almodobar's karaoke bar](http://www.grupalmodobar.com/almodobar/) in Barcelona - best night ever.  We arrived at 23:30, which was great as the place was empty and we got the microphones to ourselves for almost an hour, enough to warm up and drink up (with the mandatory tequila/whiskey starter shot).

The night then went savage as the place got packed: one Spaniard's 70-90's summer hit after the other, drinks, laughs, and shame rushing through the door.

Some of the songs in (our playlist) I remember:

* [Te quiero, te quiero (Nino Bravo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9g0Jnxr_4): Nerea and me
* [Barbie girl (Aqua)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhrYis509A): Albert and me
* [Eye of the Tiger (Survivor)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btPJPFnesV4): Toni and Myriam
* [Asereje (Las ketchup)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0PisGe66mY): All the group (this is just a classic)
* [Los Peces en el Rio (Can't remember which version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w8HNsAtHAY): Albert and Sara
* [Johnny Techno Ska (Paco Pil)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6ShBEtZMjs): Me and Toni
* [El del Medio de los Chichos (Estopa)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3ON8tVv4J8): Alex and Toni
* [Mi carro (Manolo Escobar)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RggsvczfGm8): Nerea and me
* [Salir, Beber (Extremoduro)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I9SXxxz17U): Albert and Miki
* [Fiesta Pagana (Mago de Oz)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTO-toY3Wao): Sara and Miki

Videos and photos are safely kept away :-)

As a bitter remark - as we (me and my family) will move to Berlin next year - nights like this with great friends like these will be fewer, we will surely miss them a lot, and we will try to find excuses to come visit them in Barcelona next year.

Thanks for the shoes!
