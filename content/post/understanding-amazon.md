# Understanding Amazon

This is part of my [Challenge to make 26 years before 2017 ends](https://github.com/alignan/things-to-do/blob/master/README.md).

This is a short post - I had in my list for a _long time_ to start using Amazon, however it is a big bone to chew at once, so I decided first to take a small stab and first understand what Amazon is all about.

[Udemy Academy](https://www.udemy.com) has a free video course on [AWS concepts](https://www.udemy.com/aws-concepts/learn/v4/content), which made easy to follow through in my mobile phone while commuting to work what Amazon is all about: VPCs, EC2, S3 and RDS (lot of acronyms).

I won't be copying here what I learned (which was quite basic), but please click the link above and enroll if you want to learn more (or look around elsewhere, whatever your prefer).

I will be taking the next course in the list: [AWS Essentials](https://www.udemy.com/aws-essentials/learn/v4/overview), which touch base on more detailed technical concepts and hands-on examples to follow.

Until then.
