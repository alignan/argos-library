# A book about Beers (or how I am less ignorant)

This is part of my [Challenge to make 26 years before 2017 ends](https://github.com/alignan/things-to-do/blob/master/README.md).

I bought [The complete beer course](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17347553-the-complete-beer-course) a couple of months ago.  It has traveled from my office and my flat in Berlin to my family house in Barcelona, however only until this week (few days before new year's eve), I have finally found the time to began reading through its pages as part of my self-imposed challenge... procrastination at its best.

However it has been far from being a burden: the book is beautiful to look at and a great addendum to (my future) coffee table, the photos and arty design are well done, and the `Two to taste` section at each chapter with suggestions of beers to drink while reading is a big plus.  The author (Joshua M. Bernstein) has a corny dad-like humor, thankfully setting a tone more close to a pub crawl and far away from snobbish remarks.

I missed to have a brief summary of beer types before deep-diving about it (each chapter covers a different type), but I'm a tabular type of guy, and google gave me a head start.

One of the facts I enjoyed reading about was the [_Reinheiitsgebot_ (purity decree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_Germany#Reinheitsgebot), [the strongest beers](http://www.beertutor.com/beers/index.php?t=highest_alcohol) (based on its ABV), and of course, to learn more about German beers (specially to have an excuse to stock my fridge in Berlin).

While reading, I procured two companions from the [Barcelona Beer Company](http://www.barcelonabeercompany.com/en/Taproom): [_Cerdos Voladores_ (Flying pigs)](http://www.barcelonabeercompany.com/en/Cerdos-Voladores) and [_La niña Barbuda_ (the bearded girl)](http://www.barcelonabeercompany.com/en/La-Nina-Barbuda) 

The `Cerdos Voladores` is a rowdy IPA (Indian Pale Ale), with Pale Ale, Carahell and Crystal malts, tuned with Centennial and Amarillo hops.  My wife is more fond of the IPAs, to me it was OK.

`La niña Barbuda` is a sturdy Brown Ale, with a generous mix of malts (Pale Ale, Caramunich T2, Carafa, Flacked Wheat), and Northern Brewer and Cascade hops.  I liked this one better, it had a stronger taste but easier in the mouth, its sweet aftertaste had the perfect finishing touch.

As a plus, the beers from the Barcelona Beer Company are made with water from the [Font del Regàs (Montseny Natural Reserve)](http://www.spain.info/en/que-quieres/naturaleza/espacios-naturales/parque_natural_de_massis_del_montseny.html), a beautiful sanctuary in Barcelona.

I really enjoy a good Pilsner - altough not highly reputed as others - after living for a long time under the Colombian sun at 38°C, it was a true blessing to have a cold beer easy to drink fast, whilst retaining its flavor and _aroma_.

Pour a cold one!
