# Remove duplicate photos and videos in MAC (tip)

I'm reluctant to render myself to the mercy of `iCloud` and `iTunes`, thus when syncing my photos from my mobile phone and others, sometimes I end up with plenty of duplicates... I'm trying to break free...

[DupeGuru](https://www.hardcoded.net/dupeguru/) is a simple tool that does the job, allowing to find duplicates using file names and content, and then moving to a chosen location, delete, etc.

>dupeGuru is a tool to find duplicate files on your computer. It can scan either filenames or contents. The filename scan features a fuzzy matching algorithm that can find duplicate filenames even when they are not exactly the same. dupeGuru runs on Mac OS X and Linux.

Drawback: probably you need to run the scan twice to really get all files, as I was first running to find images only, some extensions (and its spelling variations) were not picked up properly - probably it is better just to run for general files to begin with.

I sorted out 2.78GB of duplicated files (2.418 roughly) out of 9GB total in less than half-hour (MacBook Pro).
