# My latest geocaches

This is part of my [Challenge to make 26 years before 2017 ends](https://github.com/alignan/things-to-do/blob/master/README.md).

>Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game using GPS-enabled devices. Participants navigate to a specific set of GPS coordinates and then attempt to find the geocache (container) hidden at that location.

The [history of Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/about/history.aspx) goes back to the year 2000 and the invention of GPS itself, with `The Great American GPS Stash Hunt` as a way to test the accuracy of the devices hunting a hidden bucket in Beavercreek, Oregon, near Portland.  

I fell in love with [Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/play) a couple of years ago while browsing the web, my first reaction was "WOW! we are surrounded by hidden treasures".  I rushed through the door and rediscovered streets and places I used to know, swollen with secrets and containers hidden at plain sight from [muggles](https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-With-Geocaching-Muggles).

I had to make Geocaching a part of my 2017 challenge: find three geocaches in three different cities.

To be completely honest, I rushed this hunt to the last moment (the day before new year's eve), thus I had to technically narrow my town's boundaries to find two geocaches in two different cities, although Bellaterra is a [quarter of Cerdanyola del Valles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellaterra).  The first one of the challenge was in Berlin.  I missed the chance to find Geocaches while traveling to the Czech Republic and Hamburg, and now I regret this fondly.

Here are my latest three geocaches:

[GC3PV5N: Linie 1 der Tradi](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3PV5N_linie-1-der-tradi): No photo from that day, however a nicely hidden container below the U-bahn line 1.

[GC5KWJA: Cerdanyola Modernista - Torre Vermella](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5KWJA_cerdanyola-modernista-torre-vermella): we (my family) came looking for this one almost two years since our last attempt to find it.

[GC71BBX: Hay que hacer deporte](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC71BBX_hay-que-hacer-deporte): found late afternoon while taking a long walk with our dog.

I will definitely include this challenge in 2018.
